# Project Title and Description

Energy Analytics Backbone: This repo holds an engine that is the backbone for preprocessing of electric and gas energy data to prepare for analytical discovery. Numerous additional energy values are calculated from the raw usage data and then insights are discovered from the data.

I wrote this engine in 2015 as part of a side project that I worked on with another software architect.

This data processing portion of the analytical engine is written in Pivotal HAWQ SQL which is based on PostgreSQL.
